# Our Group Task

## Project Description
Our Group Project task is to build a web application that meets the following requirements:
- Uses at least two server-side APIs
- Styled with CSS framework such as Bootstrap
- Deployed on GitHub Pages
- Interactive with modals instead of alerts
- Uses client-side storage for persistent data
- Responsive
- Polished user interface
- Clean code repository with good coding standards
- Quality README with a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application.

## User Story
As a foodie, I want to be able to choose between eating in or eating out:
- Eating In: 
  - I want access to information to cook my own meals, including food item names, descriptions, recipes, calories, nutrients, instructions, and video links. 
- Eating Out: 
  - I want to be able to order from my favorite restaurant using my postcode or city name, and access information such as location on the map, city name, restaurant name, address, postcode, menu, and website URL.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Mandatory Requirements
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Use Bootstrap or some other CSS framework.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- No use of alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Responsive.
- Polished user interface.
- Clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, class/id naming, indentation, comments, etc.).
- Quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### Endpoint Requirements
- RESTful interface for a client-server made up of clients, servers, and resources with requests managed through HTTP.
- API for retrieving food items and nutritional information.
- API for “Eating In” should support filtering food items by name, description, ingredients, calories, instructions, and video links.
- API for “Eating Out” should support filtering food items by restaurant names, location, route planner, and auto address complete using the user's IP address.
- Pre-populated search bar on the "Eat In" page for specific food items.
- Limit search results to a set number to avoid overpopulation.

### Data Requirements
- Accurate and up-to-date information for food items and nutritional content.
- Information on ingredients and recipes.
- Local storage function for user search history.

### Security Requirements
- Secure authentication to protect access to sensitive data.
- SSL/TLS encryption for all requests and responses.

### Performance Requirements
- Handle high traffic volumes and multiple concurrent requests.
- Response time of less than 2 seconds for 99% of requests.
- Low error rate, with less than 1% of requests returning errors.

### Documentation Requirements
- Clear and concise README documentation for developers.
- Screenshots to show work and changes.
- Samples and demonstrations with explanations for common use cases.

### Testing Requirements
- Thorough testing of project functionality, including performance, security, and user experience.
- Tests on multiple devices and platforms for compatibility.
- Tested with real-world data for accuracy and performance.

### Evidence Requirements
- Organized README document with "Unique Name, Description, Technologies used, Screenshots, and Link to deployed Application".
